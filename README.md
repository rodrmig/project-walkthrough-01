# Project Details
1. Open a csv file, make sure it stores values that can be graphed
2. Read all of the data stored in it and move it into a 2-D array, make sure any numerical data is converted into the proper type
3. Graph the data from the file
4. Export the graph into an image, could be png or jpg
5. Save the data from the 2-D array and the graph image into a new excel

## 1. Open a csv file, make sure it stores values that can be graphed
For this step I will manually create a very simple csv with three points (x and y coordinates). See this ```graph_points.csv``` file in this repository.

```
1,1
2,2
3,3
```
